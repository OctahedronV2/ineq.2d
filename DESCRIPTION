    Coefficient of Variation.

Description: Functions performing two-dimensional decomposition of the Theil 
    index and the squared coefficient of variation. Both indexes can be
    decomposed by some feature that members of the studied population possess 
    (e.g., sex, education, age) and their income sources at the same time. 
    Decomposition of the Theil index is performed according to Giammatteo (2007) 
    <www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/liswps/466.pdf>.
    Decomposition of the squared coefficient of variation is performed according to
    Garcia-Penalosa & Orgiazzi (2013) <doi.org/10.1111/roiw.12054>.
